Git addin for Tomboy
===========================

This addin provides Git repository viewer integration for Tomboy.
Currently, it's limited to gitg.

When commits are dragged from the commit view in gitg and dropped
into a Tomboy note, a git link is created in the note. Clicking the
link will open the commit again in the repository viewer.

To install the addin for a local user, type
make && make install

You will need the gmcs compiler and of course Tomboy
for this to succeed.

Then activate the addin in the Tomboy addin dialog,
"Desktop Integration" section.

To install system wide, just copy the file Git.dll to the system
wide addin folder (e.g. /usr/lib/tomboy/addins)
